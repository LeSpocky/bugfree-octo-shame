 *  @brief  bugfree-octo-shame aka testing a double linked list and how
 *          much threads we can create â€¦
 *
 *  @details    We want to test how much threads a Linux system can
 *              create and keep running. For this we spawn threads and
 *              let the main program watch the action. The information
 *              about the threads is stored in a double linked list.
